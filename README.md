# Avatar-Characters-MVC
This assignment requires that you create an ASP.Net Core MVC project. The assignment requires that you create a database called AvatarCharacters.
Option 1: Avatar
This assignment requires that you create an ASP.Net Core MVC project. The assignment requires that you create a database called AvatarCharacters. With a table called Fighters, the table columns should be named:
• BenderName
• Origins
• Age
• Ability(water,earth,fire and fire bending, lava bending, and blood bending)
The above needs to be created using EntityFramework as well as using the various migration commands. Once you have created the database and table please add the following records to your table manually:
• Aang, Southern Air Temple,12, Air bender All the elements
Once you have inserted the first records above into the database you will need to retrieve all the records from the database and display the records on a web page. Also, you will need to use some bootstrap classes. To make GUI much more presentable.
The next step is to allow the user to insert and edit records to the database. For the insertion of Fighter’s records please allow the user’s to fill in all the required columns to add a new fighter into the database. you can insert any character record you wish. The same thing needs to be done for the edit page.
Marks will also be given for validations
Extra marks will also be given towards the overall impression of the project as well as the GUI
Once you are with the application you will need to take screenshots of the data in the browser as well as the C# code and paste it into a word document , where you briefly explain the C# code and output. Please take screenshots of the validations as well
